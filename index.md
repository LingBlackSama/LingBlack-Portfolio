This website is for someone who wants to know about me and hire me to work on different platforms. 

### About Me

I'm LingBlack. I’m an R6 Roblox animator and a scripter which mainly focus on Lua and Luau. I like making new friends and watching Anime. Although I'm not a professional animator or scripter, I will do my best in animating and scripting.

### Work and Previous Experience

[Small project: LB Calculator (Discontinue)](https://lingblacksama.github.io/LB-Calculator/)

[LB Performance](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/lb-performance-a-simple-module-that-optimize-your-game-performance/1940376)

### Available and Work Times

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I’m available from Saturday to Sunday! My working hours are:

Saturday - Sunday:
12:00pm - 4:00pm (GMT-7)

### Payment

The payment (price) per asset or per assets pack depends on the complexity. If you want an entire game scripted, obviously is completely different.

Anyway, prices are always negotiable until the negotiation is closed. I would prefer to sign a contract as a Developer to ensure that I’ll get paid!

I don’t have a really ToS for my own, but I’ll never create one if the community is good with me, without scams, etc.

### Contact and Social Medias
You can contact me by sending a friend request to my discord. I list below my social media and where you can contact me.

Discord : Mitsuri Kanroji#3729
Have a nice day and I hope we can get in contact soon!
