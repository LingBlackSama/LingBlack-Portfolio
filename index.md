### About Me

I'm LingBlack. I’m an R6 Roblox animator and a scripter that mainly uses Lua and LuaU. I like making new friends and watching Anime. Although I'm not a professional animator or scripter, I will do my best in animating and scripting.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LingBlackSama/LingBlack.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
